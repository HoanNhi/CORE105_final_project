# Design and System Thinking final project: Controllable telescope mount

Prompt: Discovering and deploying a solution to an existing problem.

Motivation: STEM and physics are two subjects that help to develop critical thinking in high school students, but the curriculum taught in school may not be appropriate for them. We discovered a lack of practical parts and motivation in teaching and learning through surveys and interviews: theory explanation is difficult to process, materials in need are both insufficient and potentially costly. Those lead us to dive deep into engaging students who are curious to learn more about these two subjects. 

Solution: Building a kit consisting of a small controllable ALT-AZ telescope mount via an app named Stellarium and a small telescope so that high school students can learn STEM by assembling the kits and physics by learning how a telescope works.

The repository contains the following files:
1. Final project report.
2. Arduino code to communicate with an app named Stellarium and control motors.
3. A C++ header files with definition of necessary functions, constants, and variables.
4. A Fusion360 design file of the telescope mount.
5. A Fusion360 design file of the holder of the telescope.
